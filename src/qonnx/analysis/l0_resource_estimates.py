"""DSP Type: a) None:
                    For Fixed Points and floating point
                        1) When dsp_type is None. All operations will be processed using LUTs.
                        2) LUTs are calculated using: 1.1*b_width1*b_width2
                        2) Example:
                            a) op_mac_Int4_Int2: 1.1*4*2 = 8.8 LUTs.
                            b) op_mac_Int8_INT8: 1.1*8*8 = 70.4 LUTs.
                            c) op_mac_Int8_FLOAT16: 1.1*8*16 = 140.8 LUTs
                            d) op_mac_FLOAT16_FLOAT16: 1.1*16*16 = 281.6 LUTs.

             b) DSP48:
                    For Fixed Points
                        1) Everything less than 4 will be promoted to 4. For ex: INT2 will use the same resources as INT4.
                        2) INT4: One dsp48 + 200 LUTs can accomodate 4 (4*4) bit mac.
                                So, no of dsp's from mac's can be calculated as (0.25).mac_count + (200*0.5)*mac_count LUTs.
                        3) Everything between 5 and 8 will be promoted to 8, Ex: INT6 will use the same resources as INT8.
                        4) INT88: One dsp48 + 200 LUTs can accomodate 2 (8*8) bit mac. So,
                                 no of dsp's from mac's can be calculated as (0.5).mac_count + (200*0.25)*mac_count LUTs.
                    For Floating Points
                        1) FLOAT32: 2 dsp + 700 LUT can accomodate 1 mac count.
                        2) FLOAT16: 1 dsp + 400 LUT can accomodate 1 mac count.
            c) DSP58:
                    For Fixed Points
                        1) INT8: One dsp58 can accomodate 3 (8*8) bit mac.
                           So, no of dsp's from mac's can be calculated as (0.33)*mac_count.
                        2) INT4: One dsp58 can accomodate 4 (4*4) bit mac.
                           So, no of dsp's from mac's can be calculated as (0.25)*mac_count.
                        3) INT16: 1 mac count requires 1 dsp.
                    For Floating Points
                        1) FLOAT32:  1 mac count requires 1 dsp.
                        2) FLOAT16: 1 mac count requires 1 dsp.
    Mapping strategy for On-Chip Memory (bits_per_res):
                        a) 1 "BRAM" can accomodate 36*1024 = 36864 bits.
                        b) 1 "URAM" can accomodate 288*1024 = 294912 bits.
